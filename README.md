**Darkos** is a project designed to run Windows x86_64 applications and games in [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) native GLIBC.
It utilizes [Box86](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86)
and [Box64](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86)
to run [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) on android.

# Installation:
1. Install
[Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk),
[Termux-X11](https://github.com/ahmad1abbadi/extra/releases/download/apps/termux-x11.apk) and
[Input Bridge v0.1.9.9](https://github.com/ahmad1abbadi/extra/releases/download/apps/InputBridge_v0.1.9.9.apk) or [Input Bridge v0.0.7](https://github.com/ahmad1abbadi/extra/releases/download/apps/input+bridge+0.0.7.apk)
or 
[X input Bridge](https://github.com/ahmad1abbadi/extra/releases/download/apps/XinputBridge.apk)
for using game controller (Bluetooth/ usb) inside wine.

1. Open Termux and paste the following command:
```bash
curl -o install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmad1abbadi/darkos/main/installOS.sh && chmod +x install && ./install
```

3. **Darkos** will automatically start after installation is complete.
   Remember each time you open Termux, Darkos will auto-start.
   
   To exit **Darkos** and use Termux normally, press '1' within the first 4 seconds. Otherwise, Darkos will start and run Wine + Termux-X11.
   
# Features:
1. Native Gstreamer support, which is required for games like:
* resident evil 7
* devil may cry 5
* amid evil
2. Dedicated configuration app
3. Many games will work without altering box64 dynarec settings

  And many more, you can discover by your self.
  
# Configuration:

## Box64/Box86 Configuration + Dynarec
The configuration can be easily done from the Darkos configuration app. Simply modify the Box options, click "Apply," and then "Reboot" to apply the changes.

For more information about dynarec variables see [Box64 usage](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/blob/main/docs/USAGE.md) and [Box86 usage](https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86/blob/master/docs/USAGE.md)

## Update OS
This option updates Darkos to the latest version.

## Wine Manager 
Wine can be installed or uninstalled from the Darkos configuration embedded within Wine. Simply select the "Wine manager" option.

To select a Wine container, use the container dropdown menu from the Darkos configuration and then click "Change container."


## Debug Mode
This mode enables printing Wine and Box64 debug information to a log file located at /sdcard/darkos/darkos.log. You can share this file to our Telegram group.

## Toggle Mangohud
Mangohud is an on-screen display (OSD) that shows useful information like FPS, CPU usage, GPU load, and GPU temperature.

Currently, to see GPU load and temperature stats, you need to disable SELinux by running the following command in Termux(root is required):
```
su -c setenforce 0
```
To re-enable SELinux:

```
su -c setenforce 1
```

## GPU Driver Changer
This option allows you to change the GPU driver.

## Switch IB
This toggle lets you switch the input bridge between version 0.1.9.9 and version 0.0.7. Choose the version that works best for you.

## Kill Services
Use this toggle to kill services.exe without needing to open the task manager.

## Hit F5 key
This will open the task manager.

## DXVK changer 
This option lets you choose the DXVK version, allowing you to select the one that works best for a specific game.

## Install Tweaks
This option lets you install Wine tricks like apps, DLLs, and fonts.

## Personalize
You can change the theme, background, or resolution of the Wine desktop.

## Termux-X11 resolution 
The fallback resolution is only used when the X11 resolution cannot be detected automatically. The default fallback resolution is 800x600.

### Device
* Most Android phones equipped with a Mali GPU can run DirectX 9 games using [Mesa VirGL](https://github.com/alexvorxx/Mesa-VirGL) . It is recommended to use a Snapdragon device with Adreno 6xx or Adreno 7xx for optimal performance and compatibility with Turnip and [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk).

### Root
* Root is not required.

## Known issues
* termux app can show signal 9 when using wine or while compiling box64, in this case you have to disable android phantom process killer.
